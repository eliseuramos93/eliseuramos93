# üëã Hi there

My name is Eliseu, I'm a web developer seeking my first job. Nice to meet you!

I've worked for some big companies here in Brazil (such as Nubank, iugu, among others) in the Customer Experience/Support area for 6 years. Then, I've decided to change my path to become a web developer. This intro will tell you about my journey in this transition so far!

# üèÅ Achievements

## Completed the [TreinaDev](https://app.campuscode.com.br/certificado/L8bH1WhMT4Xf22NdxHaCDWs8) program

I was approved to participate in this program after passing a basic web knowledge test and a few coding challenges in plain Ruby.

In this course, I've built my first complex application in the [Pousadaria](https://github.com/eliseuramos93/pousadaria-app) project, where I also had to provide some API endpoints for a VueJS application, the [Pousadaria VueJS](https://github.com/eliseuramos93/pousadaria-app-vuejs), over the course of one month. In this part of the program, the focus was on learning to program using the Test-Driven Development process using RSpec to build a reliable application and work with deadlines, as we had weekly sprints with new tasks required every Monday.

After the individual project, I was approved to participate in the team project challenge. All approved participants were split into two squads, and each squad was responsible for building an application with features intertwined with the other squad's app. They were the [Portfoliorrr](https://github.com/TreinaDev/td11-portfoliorrr) and the [Cola?Bora!](https://github.com/TreinaDev/td11-cola-bora) projects. As a member of the Portfoliorrr squad, I worked with new dynamics I had never encountered before, such as Pair Programming, Feature Branches, Code Review, Daily Meetings, Sprint Reviews, Backlog Refinement, and learned about new tools, such as Bootstrap, SolidQueue, Rubocop, Simplecov, Faraday, Fakerrr, among others.

## Completed the RebaseLabs challenge

In this challenge, we had to build a simple web application for displaying test results for users using Ruby. The catch was: we weren't allowed to use Rails, so we could understand a little bit more about how Rails makes our lives much easier with its magic, and we had to use Docker containers for every single part of the application (one for the frontend, another for the backend, one for the database, and so on).

I learned how to handle Docker containers, volumes, networks, Dockerfiles, and Docker Compose. I learned how to handle PostgreSQL with a Ruby application without Rails holding my hand, learned about Sidekiq and Redis for asynchronous processing as an option for the SolidQueue that I learned before, and had to use vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to utilize the Fetch API to provide users with a Single-Page Application experience.
